# The universal Calendar
- for sake of convenience, most traders in the world use a standardized calendar based around a six-day week.
	- local calendars may differ, but most people will know to how to convert to universal dates
## How it works
- A regular year consists of 12 months of 30 days each, divided into 5 weeks of 6 days
	- 360 days total
- Every 6th year, a leap month of 30 days is added
	- 365 days average
- Every 4th leap year, so every 24 years, an extra "overleap" week of 6 more days is added to the leap month
	- 365.25 days average
