# The universal Calendar
- for sake of convenience, most traders in the world use a standardized calendar based around a six-day week.
	- local calendars may differ, but most people will know to how to convert to universal dates
- (*an earlier version of this calendar counted in base 6, but that was more headache than it was worth*)
## How it works
- A regular year consists of 12 months of 30 days each, divided into 5 weeks of 6 days
	- 360 days total
- Every 6th year, a leap month of 30 days is added
	- 365 days average
- Every 4th leap year, so every 24 years, an extra "overleap" week of 6 more days is added
	- 365.25 days average
## Month names
- the 12 regulars simply translate to january - december. 
- the leap month is simply called "leap"
- the extra leap week is called "overleap"
## Day Names
1. Monday
2. Tuesday
3. Midweek
4. Thursday
5. Friday
6. Sunday

Again, assuming convenient translation for ease of communication.
## Date naming
- dates are usually formatted as in "the second friday of january"
-
